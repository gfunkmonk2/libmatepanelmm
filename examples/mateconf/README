In order for this to work, you need to edit the .server file by replacing PREFIX with the directory
where this tree is.  Then put the .server file in /usr/lib/matecomponent/servers (or wherever your matecomponent 
server files are located).  You may need to restart the panel to get this applet to show up in
the menu.
