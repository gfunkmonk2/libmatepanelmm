0. Documentation, documentation, documentation:
    a) I hate sparsely documented libs/programs/etc. so this will not be a problem
       with my stuff.  Please, if you have doc suggestions, file a bug!  If our
       wording improves on the mate-panel-applet docs, file a bug with the mate-panel-applet project
       as well.  If you don't document, you will get an email asking for it :).
    b) If you don't understand wrapping, or simply just want to do documents, please check
       out docs/undocumented to see what you can document.  Thank you!

1. Figure out a better way to implement mate_panel_applet_mateconf_*_list.  Should it be a template/inline
   function?  Probably. There is similar, working, stuff in mateconfmm itself.
